\title{Calculate Correlation in Local Ancestry (K = 3)}
\usage{
get_corr_chr(
  chrom,
  binsize = 0.5,
  map,
  pop1.gds,
  pop2.gds,
  pop3.gds,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{chrom}{chromosome number that you are analyzing}

\item{binsize}{size (in cM) of distance bins for calculating correlation; default = 0.5 cM}

\item{map}{map file; data frame with, at minimum, columns 'chr' and 'cM'}

\item{pop1.gds}{name of GDS file storing local ancestry calls for chrom of interest, with alleles coded as 1 = pop 1 ancestry, 0 = pop 2 or 3}

\item{pop2.gds}{name of GDS file storing local ancestry calls for chrom of interest, with alleles coded as 1 = pop 2 ancestry, 0 = pop 1 or 3}

\item{pop3.gds}{name of GDS file storing local ancestry calls for chrom of interest, with alleles coded as 1 = pop 3 ancestry, 0 = pop 1 or 2}

\item{verbose}{do you want to print updates to screen; default = TRUE}
}
\value{
A data table with the observed correlation in local ancestry vectors for a subset of loci on this chromosome.
}
\description{
Calculate the correlation of local ancestry vectors
for a single chromosome. Code is currently only applicable to
admixed populations with three ancestral populations.
